<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to the ML-SPL Performance App. </p>

<p>This app demonstrates the performance experiments of <strong>ML-SPL</strong> (<em>Machine Learning - Search Processing Language</em>), which encompasses the commands and algorithms underneath the <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/">Machine Learning Toolkit App</a>. </p>

<p>Using this dashboard, you can browse the results of performance testing of ML-SPL. For each algorithm implemented in ML-SPL, we measure running time, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and disk activity when fitting models on up to 1,000,000 search results, and applying models on up to 10,000,000 search results, each with up to 50 fields.</p>
